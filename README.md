# Motif-Dock
Motif-Dock is a protein-protein interaction (PPI) search pipeline for proteins containing specific substructures (3D) or sequence motifs (2D). Motif-Dock can be used to search for potential PPI partners for specific receptors or protein scaffolds fusing specific motifs such as antigenic epitopes.


Introduction
----

Some proteins can bind to the same receptor at the same site with similar binding patterns, which is a common phenomenon in PPI. Most of the time, these proteins belong to the same protein family and have a high degree of sequence similarity. However, these proteins can sometimes be scattered among a diverse family of proteins, maintaining sequence conservation for a small segment of the sequence or even no apparent sequence conservation.

Figure. Kinds of PPI protein motifs.

The short conserved sequence between the disordered protein and the receptor is called sequence motif, such as the TRAF6 and its substrates (shown in Figure A). Some protein substructures that are scattered among different protein families and no obvious conservation in sequence are called structural motifs, such as CRBN and its substrate proteins with different 3D overall structures, as shown in Figure B. The development of Motif-Dock was inspired by these PPIs that are difficult to search by sequence alignment methods (e.g. Blast).
